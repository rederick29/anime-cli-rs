# anime-cli-rs

A tool for searching and ~streaming~ (currently only downloading) anime from the cli.
NOTE: This is a WIP. Any issues or feature requests are welcome, however, I am prioritising finishing the basic functionality of the program first.

### Dependencies
* libtorrent-rasterbar = 1.2 (2.0 might work, not tested) *(build and runtime dependency)*
* lld linker *(build dependency)*
