# anime-cli-rs

A tool for searching and ~streaming~ (currently only downloading) anime from the cli.
NOTE: This is a WIP. Any issues or feature requests are welcome, however, I am prioritising finishing the basic functionality of the program first.

### Dependencies
* libtorrent-rasterbar >= 1.2 *(build and runtime dependency, must be linked against same version as runtime)*
* lld linker *(build dependency)*
